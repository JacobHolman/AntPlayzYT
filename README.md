### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is AntPlayz, I'm a 13 year old software developer and a Minecraft YouTuber.

I have 2+ years of expeience in programming, and about a year of experience in Java. I've been into tech ever since I was about 6 years old.

I have fun programming things like Minecraft clients, Minecrat plugins, and also developing Minecraft servers. In my free time, I like to mess around with Linux.
